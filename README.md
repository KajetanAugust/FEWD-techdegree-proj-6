This is my submission for Unit 6 project. It's the "browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase." 

Letters are uncovered with the css transition

If the player guesses all the letters correctly the You Won! message is shown with the button giving option to play again.

For every missed letter player looses one heart and missed variable gets + 1. If the missed variable value is 5, all hearts are lost and You lose screen is shown with the button giving option to play again.

If play again button is clicked the game is reset and player can start over.
